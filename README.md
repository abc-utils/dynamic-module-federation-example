This README showcases the usage of the 'dynamic-module-federation' package. 
This package is integrated into a host application to enable dynamic importing of the module federated app called 'remote'. 
To serve the remote application, execute yarn run serve. 
Launch the host application by running yarn dev. 
Within the host app, the button from the remote app is consumed using dynamic module federation.
